## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Sania, and I am currently a masters student at the University of Freiburg, Germany. I am studying a wonderful ensemble of artificial intelligence and embedded systems concepts in my masters program, which makes me a perfect candidate for state-of-the-art Internet of Things projects using AI. 

- ðŸ”­ Apart from studying, Iâ€™m currently working part-time on interesting python based projects at Wiferion-PULS GmbH, a German company that makes wifeless battery charging systems for mobile robots. (Voted 2025 product of the year!).
    - My focus is on:
      - Python (OPENCV, Flask, Matplotlib, Streamlit, etc.)
      - backend technologies (gunicorn, nginx and apache2 on Linux) and
      - PostgreSQL. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning how to code for production envinronments suitable for scaling: Docker containers, WebApps for data visualization and more!
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on unique artificial intelligence projects for my [masters thesis].
