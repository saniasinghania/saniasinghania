## Hi there 👋, my name is Sania

I am currently a masters student at the University of Freiburg, Germany. I am studying a wonderful ensemble of artificial intelligence and embedded systems concepts in my masters program, which makes me a perfect candidate for state-of-the-art Internet of Things projects using AI. When I'm not building models or doing assignments, I can be found doing yoga🧘‍♀️ , catching sunsets 🌄, or hiking in the beautiful black forest region 🚶‍♀️🏔️. 

- 🔭 Apart from studying, I’m currently working part-time on interesting python based projects at [<img src="assets/wiferion_logo.png" alt="Wiferion GmbH" height="20px">](https://www.wiferion.com/), a German company that makes wifeless battery charging systems for mobile robots. (Voted 2025 product of the year!).
    - My focus is on:
      - Python (OPENCV, Flask, Matplotlib, Streamlit, etc.)
      - backend technologies (gunicorn, nginx and apache2 on Linux) and
      - PostgreSQL. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to code for production envinronments suitable for scaling: Docker containers, WebApps for data visualization and more!
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on unique artificial intelligence projects for my [masters thesis].
